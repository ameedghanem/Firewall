# Information Security Workshop
 In this [workshop](https://course.cs.tau.ac.il/secws20/) I built a [Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing)) in 3 steps. Firstly, I implemented a stateless firewall, then I improved it by adding a connection table which made it a statefull firewall and application aware firewall. And Lastly, I chose 2 different vulnerabilties and upgraded it to counter them!
